# BruteForcer
An ethical hacking tool made with Python and it's requests library. The program uses a website URL, a list of usernames, a list of passwords, and the string presented by a webpage during a failed login attempt to try and find the proper login credentials for an account on a website. The program sends username and password combinations to a web page's URL and if the combination fails, the program tries another combination. If a username and password combination succeeds, the program presents them to the user. If no combination works, the program lets the user know that the username and password lists do not contain the target information.
